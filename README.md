# My Favorite Things
I create one mobile first page. This page will show three  my favorite things and a related video, you can click on it to view.

## Description
Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. Design a database that contains at least 4 columns - you must include an image of some kind and descriptive data about each of those things. Use the class authoring files as a reference - however DO NOT use the design files - make something better.

## Installation
Just clone the repo anywhere on your computer and create branches!

## Contributing

1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
